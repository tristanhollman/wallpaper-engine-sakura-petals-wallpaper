# wallpaper-engine-sakura-petals-wallpaper

Project files for the wallpaper I made for Wallpaper Engine (on Steam) based on my [rr-fancy-time](https://github.com/tristanhollman/rr-fancy-time) hackathon project at [R&R WFM](https://github.com/rr-wfm).

The project exists of two parts,
- The [webapp](/webapp) directory contains a simplified version of the [rr-fancy-time](https://github.com/tristanhollman/rr-fancy-time) react application.
- The [wallpaper-engine-project](/wallpaper-engine-project) directory contains the actual files used/generated to create the wallpaper in the Wallpaper Engine Creator.

As I don't intent to continue with this and only wanted to try and make something for Wallpaper Engine. It's a very barebones version without any configuration options whatsoever.
The wallpaper files were also copied manually from the build output of the webapp, I did not bother with setting up a (semi) automated process for this ðŸ¤—.
